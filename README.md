This is a simple custom Firebot script to use in a command to allow a quick chat message
that summarizes custom commands that start with a "!" and a specified tag.

Copy this into your `scripts` folder to make it available, then set the tag that should be searched.

I created this because I have a lot of sound triggers and I wanted to have a more compact view
than !commands gives.

This has minimal error handling; it's quick and dirty, but it does what I need.
